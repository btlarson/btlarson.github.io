                <p>
                  Single cells can display remarkably sophisticated, seemingly animal-like behaviors, orchestrating active processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium in order to carry out proper biological functions. While complex behaviors in animals, generally stemming from neural activity, have been extensively studied, we know comparatively little about the principles and mechanisms of cellular behavior. In individual cells, behaviors emerge directly from the joint action of chemical reactions, cellular architecture, and physical mechanisms and constraints within the cell and in its local environment. We are accumulating an increasingly sophisticated and detailed understanding of the molecular components of cells, but there remains great difficulty in translating this knowledge into understanding of how cells work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  How do cells control behavior? Put another way, how do cells decide what to do from one moment to the next and then properly execute these decisions? Furthermore, how do these capacities evolve? To answer these questions, I am combining theory from non-equilibrium physics and computer science with experiments investigating the sensorimotor and algorithmic behavior of ciliates (primarily <i>Euplotes</i>) and amoebae. This work will develop new tools, both theoretical and experimental, for interrogating the control of complex cellular behaviors while shedding new light on principles underlying cellular decision-making and behavior.

              <h1>Principles of multicellular morphogenesis</h1>
              <div class="topic">
                <p>
                  Many organisms possess the remarkable capacity to reproducibly develop into 3D structures starting from a single cell. I am interested in both the mechanisms by which multicellular morphogenesis is accomplished and in how such capacities evolve. I am particularly interested in how the regulated interplay between active cellular processes and physical constraints gives rise to the robust generation of form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my PhD in Nicole King’s <a href="https://kinglab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">lab</a>, I studied morphogenesis in choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals (see <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>). By comparing and contrasting the biology of choanoflagellates (and other protistan relatives) with that of animals, we are beginning to learn more about the evolutionary origins of animal multicellularity, including the evolutionary origins of developmental morphogenesis. While my work focused primarily on a couple of species of choanoflagellates, with some results having potential wider implications, my interests extend broadly to principles of morphogenesis. Many protists have “simple” forms of multicellularity (in contrast to the “complex” multicellularity of plants, animals, and fungi), and my ongoing and future work aims to take comparative approaches, combining theory and experiments, to uncover principles of the regulation and evolution of morphogenesis.

                <p>
                  Much of the diversity of protists remains completely uncharacterized. A cell that could lead to important insight into fundamental biological questions, from molecular and cell biology to ecology and evolution, could show up in just about any field sample. Although genomic and transcriptomic approaches can provide an important window on microbes in the environment, there is no substitute for the relatively slow approaches of careful observation of cellular behaviors and cultivation of cells, particularly when it comes to protists where cellular structure and function is difficult if not impossible to infer from a genome or transcriptome alone. These points were made abundantly clear during my PhD when I had the good fortune to discover an exciting new species of choanoflagellate along with awesome former labmates and collaborators <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MknRtTAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Tess Linden</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D4Dk4iEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Thibaut Brunet</a> (see <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">Publications</a>).

                <p>
                  My specific research interests evolve, but I am always on the lookout for fascinating critters along with the new questions they might inspire. In fact, many of my research directions have been influenced by observations made in the field. Even if I was not lucky enough to be employed as a scientist, I would still be scooping water to find and observe protists, and I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to incorporate this kind of work into my research program. To crib an inspirational quote from Louis Agassiz that I first encountered at the <a href="https://www.mbl.edu/" target="_blank">MBL</a>, “Study nature, not books.”
